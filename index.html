<h1>Animal Shelter Intakes in Austin, TX - Location analysis</h1>

<h2>Heatmap Findings</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In general, the most animal intakes center around the I-35 corridor, with one large patch south of 290 near downtown, and another north of downtown near 183. 
</p>

<h3>Strays vs. Pets in Homes</h3>
<p>Stray intakes tended to center around the same corridor in Austin, while intakes from pets in homes were more spread out inside and outside the city. 
</p>

<h3>Dogs vs. Cats</h3>
<p>Dog intakes were more prevalent than cat intakes, and more concentrated in the downtown area, and around the I-35/71/183 corridors. Cat intakes tended to be a little more spread out than dog intakes.
</p>

<h2>Veterinarian Count Findings</h2>
After plotting the count of intake addresses within 1,700 meter radius of veterinary clinics in Austin, we found the following: 
<ul>
    <li>The most intakes occurred in the areas with the fewest vet clinics. </li>
    <li>In urban areas with a higher concentration of vet clinics, the number of intakes increased again to higher levels, a trend which could be explained simply by a higher concentration of animals in  more densely-populated areas. </li>
    <li>In one suburban area with the highest concentration of vet clinics, there was a very low intake count. </li>
</ul>
